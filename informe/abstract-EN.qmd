this Dissertation is framed in the area of topological data analysis (TDA) [@IntroductionTDA], in particular, we worked with the hypothesis testing framework to detect topological features in a manifold based on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples over it. An introduction to TDA is made and the state-of-the-art techniques in the area of ​​hypothesis testing on persistence diagrams are described. Since these diagrams are a summary measure of the homology of a dataset, they are regarded as a fundamental tool for statistical evaluation of the existence of first degree cycles, i.e. curves that cannot be deformed into a point [@WikipediaHomology]. During the process of building the persistence diagrams, a distance function, defined over the space that is sought to be described, is used, and it turns out to be crucial, obtaining very different results depending on the distance function used. Traditionally, this distance function is based on the Euclidean norm, but in this work we explore the use of the *Fermat distance* which has proven to be beneficial in datasets with an underlying topology [@PatuFermatDistance]. In particular, we perform simulations of the confidence intervals using state-of-the-art techniques on several synthetic datasets frequently used in the TDA literature [@ConfidenceSetsForPersistenceDiagrams], as well as on real datasets that may have practical use cases [@FootballRobustDataset] using both the Euclidean norm and the Fermat distance to perform these calculations. For the case of synthetic sets, in which it is possible to obtain different samples from the same distribution, we also seek to obtain a computational estimate of the power of these hypothesis tests when it comes to detecting holes in the topological spaces from which the data sets were obtained.

The results obtained show that the Fermat distance effectively manages to capture in a statistically significant and more powerful way the homology of some synthetic distributions that are commonly used in TDA's literature, where analogous techniques using the Euclidean distance fail. Results are also superior to those of the other techniques for real datasets. On the other hand, it is shown how the techniques based on the Fermat distance manage to introduce these advantages while keeping computational cost on track when the dimensionality of the data space grows, this being one of the main concerns for other techniques that have been proposed to improve the results obtained when using the Euclidean distance.

As an additional contribution, a library was developed in the R programming language that can be used for future work on the Fermat distance in this language.
