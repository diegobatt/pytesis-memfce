    abstract = "With the recent explosion in the amount, the variety, and the
                dimensionality of available data, identifying, extracting, and
                exploiting their underlying structure has become a problem of
                fundamental importance for data analysis and statistical
                learning. Topological data analysis (tda) is a recent and
                fast-growing field providing a set of new topological and
                geometric tools to infer relevant features for possibly complex
                data. It proposes new well-founded mathematical theories and
                computational tools that can be used independently or in
                combination with other data analysis and statistical learning
                techniques. This article is a brief introduction, through a few
                selected topics, to basic fundamental and practical aspects of
                tda for nonexperts.",

    abstract = {Persistent homology is a widely used tool in Topological Data Analysis that encodes multiscale topological information as a multi-set of points in the plane called a persistence diagram. It is difficult to apply statistical theory directly to a random sample of diagrams. Instead, we can summarize the persistent homology with the persistence landscape, introduced by Bubenik, which converts a diagram into a well-behaved real-valued function. We investigate the statistical properties of landscapes, such as weak convergence of the average landscapes and convergence of the bootstrap. In addition, we introduce an alternate functional summary of persistent homology, which we call the silhouette, and derive an analogous statistical theory.},

We consider the case where data are drawn from sampling a probability distribution that has support on or near a submanifold of Euclidean space. We show how to ``learn'' the homology of the submanifold with high confidence. We discuss an algorithm to do this and provide learning-theoretic complexity bounds. Our bounds are obtained in terms of a condition number that limits the curvature and nearness to self-intersection of the submanifold. We are also able to treat the situation where the data are ``noisy'' and lie near rather than on the submanifold in question.},
